### Homework 5

I originally had my homework 5 files in a homework_5 folder as recommended, but was dealing with github pages issues from not having it in a root folder (the whole /docs approach didn't work out either), so I decided to forgo the folder and have all the homework 5 files in the root directory for now and as I add more homework assignments to this repo, then include separate folders for each past assignment and have the current assignment at the root.

Additionally, I did complete the extra credit by having not only the Caramel Pecan Cinnamon Roll page implemented but also the Original Cinnamon Roll page implemented.
